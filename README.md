# cellular-automata
 A simulation of the Game of Life and the SIR(S) model

 You will find the two parts of the code in separate pyton files.
 To run one of the simulations, open the file and verify the sim.Start() function is uncommented.
 Then run the file; you will be prompted with a series of choices to guide you through the
 functionality of the code. Choose visualization to see the live modeling of either the
 Game of Life or SIR(S).

 Data files are provied in .jsonc format along with the required plots for the assignment.

 Please note that the glider speed is not displayed on the graphs, but rather output to the
 terminal after the data collection.

# A fun note!
 I encourage you to check out the OscillatorGrid() function in which I have designed a system
 that allows you to visually "draw" out the starting state you would like and the position in
 the grid for it to be placed.
